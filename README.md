# Concerto 2 Remote Video Plugin
This plugin provides support to play remotely hosted videos, like YouTube videos, in Concerto 2.

1.  Add to your Gemfile: ```gem 'concerto_remote_video'```
2.  ```bundle install```
3.  ```./script/rails generate concerto_remote_video:install install```

The last step produces a lot of output, if it runs successfully, because it recompiles the frontend js files.

## Supported hosts:
* YouTube
* Vimeo
